## hi~ i'm puddles7848.
i don't use my real name on the internet and ***i use arch btw.*** i want to learn python, and get off scratch (lol).
i am a bit of the casual gamer, i play **Minecraft Java Edition** and **Blue Archive** with Wine and Proton. i play a bit of **Roblox on [Sober](https://github.com/vinegarhq/sober).**
i'm a bit of an open femboy on the internet and love blue archive ost; even the harder ones, and i like nightcore too. if you want to contact me, i never check my email. use Discord. my username is `puddles7848`.

bye, love you stranger :3
